# Vita FNAF1

Remake of FNAF1 for the PSVita.

Homage to my [old project,](https://github.com/ghostnear/VitaFNAF1)

- ATM, I use a scuffed version of SDL3_Mixer, waiting till somebody makes a proper package.
- [This page should not be a 404.](https://github.com/vitasdk/packages/tree/master/sdl3_mixer)

# How to compile:

### PSVita:

> make bvr

NOTE: make sure you got all the [PSP2_PVR](https://github.com/GrapheneCt/PVR_PSP2) modules from the release in the assets/modules folder.

### Unix:

> make bur

### Web through Emscripten (W.I.P and unstable)

> make bbr

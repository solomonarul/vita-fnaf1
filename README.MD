# Vita FNAF1

Remake of FNAF1 targeted towards the PSVita.

Also runs on Windows, Linux and on the web using Emscriptem.

## Compilation details:

For more info there's also the [workflows](./.github/workflows/).

### PSVita:

- after installing VitaSDK, use the sdl3_pvr_psp2, pvr_psp2 and sdl3_mixer packages from [here.](https://github.com/solomonarul/vita-packages)

### Unix:

- This works out the box if you got all the packages installed.

### Web through Emscripten

- This works out of the box.
- Make sure you are not running index.html directly in the browser as browsers are not a fan of loading wasm locally.

#### Homage to my [old project,](https://github.com/ghostnear/VitaFNAF1)

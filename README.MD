# Vita FNAF1

Remake of FNAF1 for the PSVita.

Homage to my [old project,](https://github.com/ghostnear/VitaFNAF1)

- ATM, I use a scuffed version of SDL3_Mixer, waiting till somebody makes a proper package.
- [This page should not be a 404.](https://github.com/vitasdk/packages/tree/master/sdl3_mixer)
